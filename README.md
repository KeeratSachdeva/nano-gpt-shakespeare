# ðŸ”¥ Nano GPT.

A replication of [Andrej Karpathy's Nano GPT model](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) that blabbers like Shakespeare.
A ~11M parameters' character-level language model built using PyTorch to generate Shakespeare-like works based on a given dataset of ~1.1M characters of his works.

Key concepts covered:
* Decoder-only Transformer
* Self-attention mechanism
* LayerNorm, Residuals, Multi-head attention
* Training on GPU with PyTorch
* Inspired by the _Attention is All You Need_ paper
